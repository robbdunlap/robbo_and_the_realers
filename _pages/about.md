I'm Robb, a mid-career professional increasing my data analytics capability by pursuing an MS in data analytics from <a href="https://catalog.gmu.edu/colleges-schools/engineering/data-analytics-engineering-ms/">GMU</a>. I'm particulary interested in developing methods and tools to improve extraction of information from free-form text and tabular data to enable relationship discovery. The tools and methodologies I'm most interested in are natural language processing, graph databases, ontologies, graph neural networks, and bayesian statistical analysis.
